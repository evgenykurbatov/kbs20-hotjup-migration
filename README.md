# Migration of hot Jupiters by the atmospheric outflow


## Abstract

It is well known that both ionizing radiation and gravitation action of the star to the ``hot Jupyter'' leads to the outflow of the atmosphere of the planet. The outflow stream gains angular momentum from the planet, after which it accumulates forming a disk or a torus. We estimated the efficiency of the planet migration mechanism as a result of the exchange of angular momentum with the torus, on the example of system HD209458. In the 4.5x10^9 years since the evaporation of the protoplanetary disk, the planet can migrate from orbit ~0.67 AU to its current orbit 0.045 AU.

This code is suitable for calculating the evolution of surface density in a disk under the influence of tidal forces from the planet and viscous forces. It is based on the Pringle model of geometrically thin viscous accretion disk.


## Requirements

Python with Numpy, Scipy, H5Py, Matplotlib. Latest [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is OK.
